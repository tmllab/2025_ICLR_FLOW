overall_task: str = '''Develop a game that fuses Tetris and Bejeweled mechanics. Falling tetrominoes should lock into a grid and transform into colored gems. The game must support both Tetris line-clearing and Bejeweled match-3 clearing, triggering chain reactions and bonus points. Include a GUI (using a framework like Pygame) that displays the game grid, current score, and next tetromino preview, along with smooth animations. No sound effects are needed'''

overall_task: str = '''Create a Tetris game using Python with the pygame library. 
The game should feature a standard 10x20 grid for gameplay. 
Display the current falling tetromino and the next upcoming piece. 
Include a score counter, a display for the number of cleared lines, and a simple border to distinguish the game area. 
Each tetromino type should have a unique, vibrant color for clear visibility. 
The interface should be clean and modern, emphasizing gameplay clarity and user experience.'''
# use o3-mini 
overall_task: str = '''
The game should blend the core mechanics of classic **Snake** with the strategic combat elements of **Tank War**, featuring a visually engaging **graphical user interface (GUI)**. 

- The **player controls a continuously moving tank**, navigating the battlefield by steering left or right. 
- The tank must **avoid obstacles, bullet from enemy tank, and prevent self-collision** (due to a hazardous fuel trail), and **collect limited resources** like ammunition and fuel. 
- The game includes AI enemy tank that act as agents, dynamically aiming and shooting at the player. 
- The player can attack and distroy enemy tank. 
- The environment should feature multiple interactive agents including obstacles and AI-driven tanks. 
- A **real-time HUD** should display crucial information—**health, fuel, and score**—with smooth animations and **intuitive controls**. 

The implementation should be: 
- Written in **a single Python file** 
- without sound effects

overall_task: str = '''I want to create a website for the following conference:
    1). Conference Name: International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR2025)  
    2). Date: April 27, 2025 to May 1, 2025  
    3). Location: San Francisco, California, United States
    4). Organizer: International Association for Learning Representations
    Please generate a detailed website structure and content for this conference. 
    For each section, provide example HTML content. 
    Additionally, create a sample CSS stylesheet to style the website. 
    Ensure the content is professional, clear, and suitable for an international academic conference.
    Note that:
    1). The previous information I gave you must be included.
    2). The website should have conference schedule part.
    3). The website should have conference venue part with a map.

overall_task = '''1. Lecture slide:
I am a lecturer. I am teaching the machine learning coure for research students. Please generate latex code for lecture slide for different reinforcement learning algorithms.
Note that:
1). Note that the lecture duration is 2 hour, so we need to generate 30 pages.
2). for each reinforcement learning algorithms, the slide should include motivation, problem and intuitive solution and detailed math equations.
3). Please make sure the the lecture have a good self-contain.
