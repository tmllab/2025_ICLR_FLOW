                You will be given the workflow for {task} in JSON format. Your job is to:
            
                    1. Transform the JSON workflow into the required output format. Depending on the task, this could be:
                        Python code: Generate a .py file if the task is programming-related.
                        LaTeX file: Create a .tex file, such as a Beamer presentation, for documentation or slides.
                        Other formats as specified in the task.

                    2. Review and integrate outputs from all subtasks in the workflow. Ensure the final output is comprehensive and not based solely on the result of the last subtask.

                    3. Focus on producing the actual deliverable:
                        If the task specifies Python code, output a Python script.
                        If it asks for a LaTeX file, provide the full LaTeX document.
                        Avoid just summarizing the steps or describing the results—your primary goal is to create the actual output.

                    4. Keep in mind:
                        Always generate the output in the format specified by the task.
                        Ensure the final result is complete, well-structured, and ready to use.
