      "\n",
      "1. Game Board Module\n",
      "   - Create a 10x20 grid representing each cell as a drawable rectangle.\n",
      "   - Define the grid boundaries and a simple border for the game area.\n",
      "   - Handle background rendering using the pygame library.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Tetromino Module\n",
      "   - Represent each tetromino as an object with properties for shape and position.\n",
      "   - Define tetromino shapes using matrices or coordinate lists.\n",
      "   - Assign a unique, vibrant color to each tetromino type.\n",
      "   - Include methods for movement (left, right, down), rotation, and collision detection with the game board and other tetrominoes.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Game Logic Module\n",
      "   - Control the falling tetromino behavior (automatic descent, collision checking, locking in place).\n",
      "   - Manage line clearance by identifying and removing completed rows.\n",
      "   - Update the grid state following tetromino placement and line clearance.\n",
      "   - Integrate scoring system logic where points awarded depend on the number of lines cleared simultaneously.\n",
      "   - Maintain level progression based on score or lines cleared.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. UI Display Module\n",
      "   - Render the game board grid including the border.\n",
      "   - Display the current falling tetromino on the grid.\n",
      "   - Provide a preview area showing the next tetromino piece.\n",
      "   - Render a score counter and a cleared lines counter on the screen.\n",
      "   - Use a clean and modern interface style to ensure gameplay clarity and an engaging user experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Input Handling Module\n",
      "   - Process user inputs (keyboard events) for moving and rotating tetrominoes.\n",
      "   - Allow for pausing and restarting the game.\n",
      "   - Ensure inputs are responsive and do not interfere with ongoing game logic.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Integration and Main Game Loop\n",
      "   - Initialize pygame and set up the game display.\n",
      "   - Create instances of the game board and tetromino modules.\n",
      "   - Implement the main game loop to repeatedly update game logic, process user input, and refresh the display.\n",
      "   - Control the game timing and speed adjustments as the game progresses.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Additional Considerations\n",
      "   - Ensure modular design to facilitate future enhancements or refactoring.\n",
      "   - Employ collision detection both in tetromino movement and rotation to prevent illegal moves.\n",
      "   - Incorporate error handling to manage unexpected game states and input events.\n",
      "   - Optimize rendering to maintain smooth performance even on lower-end hardware.\n",
