      "1. Module Organization\n",
      "   • Game Engine: Manages game loop, tetromino spawning, movement, collision detection, and integration with the grid.\n",
      "   • Grid Manager: Maintains a 2D array representing the playing field; handles placement of tetromino blocks and their conversion into gems.\n",
      "   • Tetromino Controller: Handles tetromino creation, rotation, descent, and locking into the grid.\n",
      "   • Gem Transformation & Clearing System: Converts tetromino blocks to colored gems upon locking; applies clearing rules for Tetris lines and match-3 gem clusters, and manages chain reactions.\n",
      "   • Score System: Tracks points from line clears, gem matches, and bonus multipliers from chain reactions.\n",
      "   • GUI Module: Uses Pygame to render the game grid, display current score, show the next tetromino preview, and animate actions smoothly.\n",

      "   • Update Mechanisms: After a tetromino is locked, cells are updated by replacing tetromino blocks with gems before triggering clear checks.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Tetromino Behavior and Locking\n",
      "   • Movement: Tetrominoes descend through the grid under gravity; players can translate and rotate using controls.\n",
      "   • Collision Detection: Checks for grid boundaries and existing gems to determine safe movement.\n",
      "   • Locking: When a tetromino cannot descend further, it is locked into the grid, and its blocks are converted into gems with predetermined colors.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Gem Transformation Logic\n",
      "   • Conversion: Locked tetromino blocks transform into gems with designated colors which may differ slightly from traditional Tetris colors to support match-3 mechanics.\n",
      "   • Representation: Each gem carries color information used for matching during clearing and chain reaction evaluations.\n",
      "   • Post-Lock Process: After conversion, the grid is scanned for potential clears prompted by either complete lines (Tetris mechanic) or clusters of at least three adjacent matching gems (Bejeweled mechanic).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Clearing and Chain Reaction Rules\n",
      "   • Tetris Clearing: The grid is scanned for fully occupied rows. Completed lines are cleared, and the rows above descend.\n",
      "   • Gem Match-3 Clearing: The grid is analyzed for clusters of three or more contiguous gems of the same color. Detected clusters are cleared, with cascading gems falling to fill gaps.\n",
      "   • Chain Reactions: Clearing operations (line or gem matching) may trigger subsequent clears. Each consecutive clear within the same move sequence increases a chain multiplier that boosts the score.\n",
      "   • Scoring: Separate base scores are assigned for line clears and gem matches; additional bonus points are awarded based on the chain multiplier. Successful simultaneous triggering of both clearing mechanisms can result in extra bonus points.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Graphical User Interface (GUI)\n",
      "   • Grid Display: Renders the current state of the grid with colored gems and falling tetromino.\n",
      "   • Score Panel: Shows the current score and chain reaction multiplier.\n",
      "   • Next Tetromino Preview: Displays an upcoming tetromino to allow players to plan moves.\n",
      "   • Animations: Implements smooth transitions for tetromino movement, gem transformation, clears, and cascading falls to visually communicate chain reactions and bonus scoring.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Integration of Mechanics\n",
      "   • Fusion Principle: Tetrominoes, upon locking, serve as the origin for gem-based match-3 clearing rules. The simultaneous support of Tetris line clears allows players to trigger two different types of clearing events, both of which can occur independently or together.\n",
      "   • Game Flow: Every locked tetromino initiates a multi-stage process: transformation into gems, evaluation of Tetris line completions, and analysis for gem clusters. Chain reactions potential is maximized by the overlap of both sets of mechanics, whereby a single strategic placement can lead to cascading clears and significantly higher scores.\n",

      "   • Tetris Clearing: The grid is scanned for fully occupied rows. Completed lines are cleared, and the rows above descend.\n",
      "   • Gem Match-3 Clearing: The grid is analyzed for clusters of three or more contiguous gems of the same color. Detected clusters are cleared, with cascading gems falling to fill gaps.\n",
      "   • Chain Reactions: Clearing operations (line or gem matching) may trigger subsequent clears. Each consecutive clear within the same move sequence increases a chain multiplier that boosts the score.\n",
      "   • Scoring: Separate base scores are assigned for line clears and gem matches; additional bonus points are awarded based on the chain multiplier. Successful simultaneous triggering of both clearing mechanisms can result in extra bonus points.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Graphical User Interface (GUI)\n",
      "   • Grid Display: Renders the current state of the grid with colored gems and falling tetromino.\n",
      "   • Score Panel: Shows the current score and chain reaction multiplier.\n",
      "   • Next Tetromino Preview: Displays an upcoming tetromino to allow players to plan moves.\n",
      "   • Animations: Implements smooth transitions for tetromino movement, gem transformation, clears, and cascading falls to visually communicate chain reactions and bonus scoring.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Integration of Mechanics\n",
      "   • Fusion Principle: Tetrominoes, upon locking, serve as the origin for gem-based match-3 clearing rules. The simultaneous support of Tetris line clears allows players to trigger two different types of clearing events, both of which can occur independently or together.\n",
      "   • Game Flow: Every locked tetromino initiates a multi-stage process: transformation into gems, evaluation of Tetris line completions, and analysis for gem clusters. Chain reactions potential is maximized by the overlap of both sets of mechanics, whereby a single strategic placement can lead to cascading clears and significantly higher scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "This design provides a comprehensive blueprint for combining Tetris and Bejeweled mechanics into a coherent and engaging game experience.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Module Organization\n",
      "   • Game Engine: Manages game loop, tetromino spawning, movement, collision detection, and integration with the grid.\n",
      "   • Grid Manager: Maintains a 2D array representing the playing field; handles placement of tetromino blocks and their conversion into gems.\n",
      "   • Tetromino Controller: Handles tetromino creation, rotation, descent, and locking into the grid.\n",
      "   • Gem Transformation & Clearing System: Converts tetromino blocks to colored gems upon locking; applies clearing rules for Tetris lines and match-3 gem clusters, and manages chain reactions.\n",
      "   • Score System: Tracks points from line clears, gem matches, and bonus multipliers from chain reactions.\n",
      "   • GUI Module: Uses Pygame to render the game grid, display current score, show the next tetromino preview, and animate actions smoothly.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Grid System\n",
      "   • Representation: A two-dimensional array where each cell is either empty or contains a gem with a color attribute.\n",
      "   • Dimensions: Defined by a specific number of rows and columns; supports dynamic updates as clears occur.\n",
      "   • Update Mechanisms: After a tetromino is locked, cells are updated by replacing tetromino blocks with gems before triggering clear checks.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Tetromino Behavior and Locking\n",
      "   • Movement: Tetrominoes descend through the grid under gravity; players can translate and rotate using controls.\n",
      "   • Collision Detection: Checks for grid boundaries and existing gems to determine safe movement.\n",
      "   • Locking: When a tetromino cannot descend further, it is locked into the grid, and its blocks are converted into gems with predetermined colors.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Gem Transformation Logic\n",
      "   • Conversion: Locked tetromino blocks transform into gems with designated colors which may differ slightly from traditional Tetris colors to support match-3 mechanics.\n",
      "   • Representation: Each gem carries color information used for matching during clearing and chain reaction evaluations.\n",
      "   • Post-Lock Process: After conversion, the grid is scanned for potential clears prompted by either complete lines (Tetris mechanic) or clusters of at least three adjacent matching gems (Bejeweled mechanic).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Clearing and Chain Reaction Rules\n",
      "   • Tetris Clearing: The grid is scanned for fully occupied rows. Completed lines are cleared, and the rows above descend.\n",
      "   • Gem Match-3 Clearing: The grid is analyzed for clusters of three or more contiguous gems of the same color. Detected clusters are cleared, with cascading gems falling to fill gaps.\n",
      "   • Chain Reactions: Clearing operations (line or gem matching) may trigger subsequent clears. Each consecutive clear within the same move sequence increases a chain multiplier that boosts the score.\n",
      "   • Scoring: Separate base scores are assigned for line clears and gem matches; additional bonus points are awarded based on the chain multiplier. Successful simultaneous triggering of both clearing mechanisms can result in extra bonus points.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Graphical User Interface (GUI)\n",
      "   • Grid Display: Renders the current state of the grid with colored gems and falling tetromino.\n",
      "   • Score Panel: Shows the current score and chain reaction multiplier.\n",
      "   • Next Tetromino Preview: Displays an upcoming tetromino to allow players to plan moves.\n",
      "   • Animations: Implements smooth transitions for tetromino movement, gem transformation, clears, and cascading falls to visually communicate chain reactions and bonus scoring.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Integration of Mechanics\n",
      "   • Fusion Principle: Tetrominoes, upon locking, serve as the origin for gem-based match-3 clearing rules. The simultaneous support of Tetris line clears allows players to trigger two different types of clearing events, both of which can occur independently or together.\n",
      "   • Game Flow: Every locked tetromino initiates a multi-stage process: transformation into gems, evaluation of Tetris line completions, and analysis for gem clusters. Chain reactions potential is maximized by the overlap of both sets of mechanics, whereby a single strategic placement can lead to cascading clears and significantly higher scores.\n",
      "\n",
      "This design provides a comprehensive blueprint for combining Tetris and Bejeweled mechanics into a coherent and engaging game experience.\n",
