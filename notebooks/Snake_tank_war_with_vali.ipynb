      "    The game should blend the core mechanics of classic **Snake** with the strategic combat elements of **Tank War**, featuring a visually engaging **graphical user interface (GUI)**.  \n",
      "\n",
      "    - The **player controls a continuously moving tank**, navigating the battlefield by steering left or right.  \n",
      "    - The tank must **avoid obstacles, bullet from enemy tank, and prevent self-collision** (due to a hazardous fuel trail), and **collect limited resources** like ammunition and fuel.  \n",
      "    - The game includes AI enemy tank that act as agents, dynamically aiming and shooting at the player.  \n",
      "    - The player can attack and distroy enemy tank.  \n",
      "    - The environment should feature multiple interactive agents including obstacles and AI-driven tanks.  \n",
      "    - A **real-time HUD** should display crucial information—**health, fuel, and score**—with smooth animations and **intuitive controls**.  \n",
      "\n",
      "    The implementation should be:  \n",
      "    - Written in **a single Python file**  \n",
      "    - without sound effects  \n",

      "    - The **player controls a continuously moving tank**, navigating the battlefield by steering left or right.  \n",
      "    - The tank must **avoid obstacles, bullet from enemy tank, and prevent self-collision** (due to a hazardous fuel trail), and **collect limited resources** like ammunition and fuel.  \n",
      "    - The game includes AI enemy tank that act as agents, dynamically aiming and shooting at the player.  \n",
      "    - The player can attack and distroy enemy tank.  \n",
      "    - The environment should feature multiple interactive agents including obstacles and AI-driven tanks.  \n",
      "    - A **real-time HUD** should display crucial information—**health, fuel, and score**—with smooth animations and **intuitive controls**.  \n",

      "\n",
      "    - The **player controls a continuously moving tank**, navigating the battlefield by steering left or right.  \n",
      "    - The tank must **avoid obstacles, bullet from enemy tank, and prevent self-collision** (due to a hazardous fuel trail), and **collect limited resources** like ammunition and fuel.  \n",
      "    - The game includes AI enemy tank that act as agents, dynamically aiming and shooting at the player.  \n",
      "    - The player can attack and distroy enemy tank.  \n",
      "    - The environment should feature multiple interactive agents including obstacles and AI-driven tanks.  \n",
      "    - A **real-time HUD** should display crucial information—**health, fuel, and score**—with smooth animations and **intuitive controls**.  \n",
      "\n",
      "    The implementation should be:  \n",
      "    - Written in **a single Python file**  \n",

      "    - The player can attack and distroy enemy tank.  \n",
      "    - The environment should feature multiple interactive agents including obstacles and AI-driven tanks.  \n",

      "    - The environment should feature multiple interactive agents including obstacles and AI-driven tanks.  \n",

      "    - The **player controls a continuously moving tank**, navigating the battlefield by steering left or right.  \n",
      "    - The tank must **avoid obstacles, bullet from enemy tank, and prevent self-collision** (due to a hazardous fuel trail), and **collect limited resources** like ammunition and fuel.  \n",
      "    - The game includes AI enemy tank that act as agents, dynamically aiming and shooting at the player.  \n",
      "    - The player can attack and distroy enemy tank.  \n",
      "    - The environment should feature multiple interactive agents including obstacles and AI-driven tanks.  \n",
      "    - A **real-time HUD** should display crucial information—**health, fuel, and score**—with smooth animations and **intuitive controls**.  \n",

      "    - The player can attack and distroy enemy tank.  \n",
      "    - The environment should feature multiple interactive agents including obstacles and AI-driven tanks.  \n",

      "    - The player can attack and distroy enemy tank.  \n",
      "    - The environment should feature multiple interactive agents including obstacles and AI-driven tanks.  \n",

      "    - The player can attack and distroy enemy tank.  \n",
      "    - The environment should feature multiple interactive agents including obstacles and AI-driven tanks.  \n",

      "    - The **player controls a continuously moving tank**, navigating the battlefield by steering left or right.  \n",
      "    - The tank must **avoid obstacles, bullet from enemy tank, and prevent self-collision** (due to a hazardous fuel trail), and **collect limited resources** like ammunition and fuel.  \n",
      "    - The game includes AI enemy tank that act as agents, dynamically aiming and shooting at the player.  \n",
      "    - The player can attack and distroy enemy tank.  \n",
      "    - The environment should feature multiple interactive agents including obstacles and AI-driven tanks.  \n",
      "    - A **real-time HUD** should display crucial information—**health, fuel, and score**—with smooth animations and **intuitive controls**.  \n",

      "    - The game includes AI enemy tank that act as agents, dynamically aiming and shooting at the player.  \n",
      "    - The player can attack and distroy enemy tank.  \n",
      "    - The environment should feature multiple interactive agents including obstacles and AI-driven tanks.  \n",

      "    - The **player controls a continuously moving tank**, navigating the battlefield by steering left or right.  \n",
      "    - The tank must **avoid obstacles, bullet from enemy tank, and prevent self-collision** (due to a hazardous fuel trail), and **collect limited resources** like ammunition and fuel.  \n",
      "    - The game includes AI enemy tank that act as agents, dynamically aiming and shooting at the player.  \n",
      "    - The player can attack and distroy enemy tank.  \n",
      "    - The environment should feature multiple interactive agents including obstacles and AI-driven tanks.  \n",
      "    - A **real-time HUD** should display crucial information—**health, fuel, and score**—with smooth animations and **intuitive controls**.  \n",

      "    - The game includes AI enemy tank that act as agents, dynamically aiming and shooting at the player.  \n",
      "    - The player can attack and distroy enemy tank.  \n",
      "    - The environment should feature multiple interactive agents including obstacles and AI-driven tanks.  \n",
      "    - A **real-time HUD** should display crucial information—**health, fuel, and score**—with smooth animations and **intuitive controls**.  \n",
