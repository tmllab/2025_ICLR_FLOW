      "# Game Architecture Design for Tetris-Bejeweled Fusion\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. Game Components\n",
      "- **Grid**: A 2D array representing the game area (e.g., 10 columns x 20 rows).\n",
      "- **Tetrominoes**: Various shapes (I, O, T, S, Z, J, L) that can fall and occupy grid spaces.\n",
      "- **Gems**: Colored blocks representing the transformed tetrominoes after locking.\n",
      "- **Score System**: Tracks the player's score, updating for line clears and gem matches.\n",
      "- **Game States**: Main menu, playing, paused, and game over states.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. Game Logic\n",
      "### 2.1 Tetromino Management\n",
      "- **Spawn**: Randomly generate a tetromino at the top of the grid.\n",
      "- **Movement**: Control tetromino movement (left, right, down) and rotation.\n",
      "- **Locking Mechanism**: When a tetromino cannot move down further, it locks into the grid, transforming into gems.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2.2 Grid Interaction\n",
      "- **Line Clearing**: Check for complete rows; remove completed rows and shift everything above down.\n",
      "- **Transformation**: Upon locking, convert locked tetrominoes into random colored gems.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. Match-3 Mechanics (Overview)\n",
      "- **Gem Matching**: Check for groups of three or more adjacent gems of the same color.\n",
      "- **Clearing Gems**: Remove matched gems and trigger cascading clears if new matches occur.\n",
      "- **Score Update**: Increment the score based on the number of cleared gems and chains.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. User Interface (GUI)\n",
      "### 4.1 Layout\n",
      "- **Game Grid Display**: Render the grid and current state (tetrominoes and gems).\n",
      "- **Score Display**: Show current score prominently on the screen.\n",
      "- **Next Tetromino Preview**: Display the next tetromino that will fall.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4.2 Animations\n",
      "- **Falling Tetrominoes**: Smooth dropping animations as tetrominoes move down.\n",
      "- **Gem Transformations**: Visual effects for transforming tetrominoes into gems.\n",
      "- **Clearing Effects**: Animate the process of clearing matched gems.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. Additional Features\n",
      "- **Difficulty Scaling**: Increase speed and frequency of tetromino drops as the score rises.\n",
      "- **Power-ups**: Implement special gems that can clear larger areas or all gems of a color.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 6. Implementation Framework\n",
      "- **Game Development Framework**: Use Pygame for rendering, input handling, and animations.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 7. Development Plan\n",
      "1. Create the grid and implement tetromino spawning and locking logic.\n",
      "2. Implement gem transformation and line clearing.\n",
      "3. Develop match-3 detection and clearing mechanisms.\n",
      "4. Design and implement the GUI components.\n",
      "5. Integrate animations for a smooth player experience.\n",
      "6. Test and refine gameplay mechanics for balance. \n",
      "\n",
      "This architecture serves as a foundational blueprint for development, guiding modular implementation of core features and interactions within the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "## **Feedbacks to the revision\n",
      "Here are some feedbacks:\n",
      "1. **Completeness and Clarity**: The design is generally comprehensive but could be more detailed in a few areas. Specifically, the interaction between Tetris and Bejeweled mechanics could benefit from additional explanation, such as how the transition between different gameplay elements occurs.\n",
      "2. **Game Logic**: While the tetromino management and line clearing are well-addressed, clarifying how gem matching is integrated with the dropping of tetrominoes would enhance understanding of the gameplay flow.\n",
      "3. **User Interface**: The UI section could include more specific details about controls (e.g., how the player interacts with the game) and feedback mechanisms (e.g., sound or visual cues for actions).\n",
      "4. **Development Plan**: The steps could be more explicitly tied to the game mechanics detailed earlier in the document, ensuring clarity on how each step contributes to the overall architecture.\n",

      "## Match-3 Mechanics Implementation\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Gem Matching\n",
      "- Define a function `check_for_matches(grid)` that scans the grid for groups of three or more adjacent gems of the same color both horizontally and vertically.\n",
      "- Use a nested loop to iterate through each cell in the grid, checking horizontal and vertical sequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Clearing Gems\n",
      "- Upon detecting a match, create a list of all gem positions that are part of the match.\n",
      "- Define a function `clear_gems(grid, matches)` to remove these gems from the grid and set their positions to a placeholder (e.g., `None`).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Cascading Effects\n",
      "- After clearing gems, define a function `cascade_gems(grid)` that shifts all remaining gems down to fill the empty spaces.\n",
      "- This function should also check for new matches that result from the cascading and call the `clear_gems` function if new matches are found recursively.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Score Update\n",
      "- Maintain a scoring system to increment the score when gems are cleared. Define a function `update_score(num_cleared)` to calculate and update the score based on the number of gems cleared. Include bonus multipliers for cascade chains.\n",
      "  \n",
      "### 5. Integration with Tetromino Lock\n",
      "- Modify the tetromino lock logic to call `check_for_matches(grid)` immediately after a tetromino locks in place.\n",
      "- If matches are found, either call `clear_gems`, followed by `cascade_gems`, updating the score accordingly with `update_score`.\n",

      "  Result: # Game Architecture Design for Tetris-Bejeweled Fusion\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. Game Components\n",
      "- **Grid**: A 2D array representing the game area (e.g., 10 columns x 20 rows).\n",
      "- **Tetrominoes**: Various shapes (I, O, T, S, Z, J, L) that can fall and occupy grid spaces.\n",
      "- **Gems**: Colored blocks representing the transformed tetrominoes after locking.\n",
      "- **Score System**: Tracks the player's score, updating for line clears and gem matches.\n",
      "- **Game States**: Main menu, playing, paused, and game over states.\n",
      "- **Controls**: Player controls for moving (left, right, down), rotating tetrominoes, and initiating special gem powers.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. Game Logic\n",
      "### 2.1 Tetromino Management\n",
      "- **Spawn**: Randomly generate a tetromino at the top of the grid.\n",
      "- **Movement**: Control tetromino movement (left, right, down) and rotation.\n",
      "- **Locking Mechanism**: When a tetromino cannot move down further, it locks into the grid, transforming into gems.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2.2 Grid Interaction\n",
      "- **Line Clearing**: Check for complete rows; remove completed rows and shift everything above down.\n",
      "- **Transformation**: Upon locking, convert locked tetrominoes into random colored gems.\n",
      "- **Interaction with Gems**: If a tetromino locks in a position that creates an adjacent gem formation, immediately trigger the gem matching mechanics.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. Match-3 Mechanics (Overview)\n",
      "- **Gem Matching**: Check for groups of three or more adjacent gems of the same color.\n",
      "- **Clearing Gems**: Remove matched gems and trigger cascading clears if new matches occur.\n",
      "- **Cascading Effects**: After a tetromino locks, if a matching area occurs, it should trigger a clear and may lead to another score increment based on chain reactions.\n",
      "- **Score Update**: Increment the score based on the number of cleared gems and any consequential chains.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. User Interface (GUI)\n",
      "### 4.1 Layout\n",
      "- **Game Grid Display**: Render the grid and current state (tetrominoes and gems).\n",
      "- **Score Display**: Show current score prominently on the screen.\n",
      "- **Next Tetromino Preview**: Display the next tetromino that will fall.\n",
      "- **Controls Display**: Provide a reference for player controls (instructions on how to play and activate power-ups).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4.2 Animations\n",
      "- **Falling Tetrominoes**: Smooth dropping animations as tetrominoes move down.\n",
      "- **Gem Transformations**: Visual effects for transforming tetrominoes into gems.\n",
      "- **Clearing Effects**: Animate the process of clearing matched gems, with visual cues to signal successful actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. Additional Features\n",
      "- **Difficulty Scaling**: Increase speed and frequency of tetromino drops as the score rises.\n",
      "- **Power-ups**: Implement special gems that can clear larger areas or all gems of a color; these should be visually distinct to make them noticeable.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 6. Implementation Framework\n",
      "- **Game Development Framework**: Use Pygame for rendering, input handling, and animations.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 7. Development Plan\n",
      "1. Create the grid and implement tetromino spawning and locking logic.\n",
      "2. Implement gem transformation and line clearing.\n",
      "3. Integrate interaction mechanics with gem matching post-tetromino lock.\n",
      "4. Develop match-3 detection and clearing mechanisms.\n",
      "5. Design and implement the GUI components, including control instructions.\n",
      "6. Integrate animations for a smooth player experience with feedback.\n",
      "7. Test and refine gameplay mechanics for balance. \n",

      "## 1. Game Components\n",
      "- **Grid**: A 2D array representing the game area (e.g., 10 columns x 20 rows).\n",
      "- **Tetrominoes**: Various shapes (I, O, T, S, Z, J, L) that can fall and occupy grid spaces.\n",
      "- **Gems**: Colored blocks representing the transformed tetrominoes after locking.\n",
      "- **Score System**: Tracks the player's score, updating for line clears and gem matches.\n",
      "- **Game States**: Main menu, playing, paused, and game over states.\n",
      "- **Controls**: Player controls for moving (left, right, down), rotating tetrominoes, and initiating special gem powers.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. Game Logic\n",
      "### 2.1 Tetromino Management\n",
      "- **Spawn**: Randomly generate a tetromino at the top of the grid.\n",
      "- **Movement**: Control tetromino movement (left, right, down) and rotation.\n",
      "- **Locking Mechanism**: When a tetromino cannot move down further, it locks into the grid, transforming into gems.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2.2 Grid Interaction\n",
      "- **Line Clearing**: Check for complete rows; remove completed rows and shift everything above down.\n",
      "- **Transformation**: Upon locking, convert locked tetrominoes into random colored gems.\n",
      "- **Interaction with Gems**: If a tetromino locks in a position that creates an adjacent gem formation, immediately trigger the gem matching mechanics.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. Match-3 Mechanics (Overview)\n",
      "- **Gem Matching**: Check for groups of three or more adjacent gems of the same color.\n",
      "- **Clearing Gems**: Remove matched gems and trigger cascading clears if new matches occur.\n",
      "- **Cascading Effects**: After a tetromino locks, if a matching area occurs, it should trigger a clear and may lead to another score increment based on chain reactions.\n",
      "- **Score Update**: Increment the score based on the number of cleared gems and any consequential chains.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. User Interface (GUI)\n",
      "### 4.1 Layout\n",
      "- **Game Grid Display**: Render the grid and current state (tetrominoes and gems).\n",
      "- **Score Display**: Show current score prominently on the screen.\n",
      "- **Next Tetromino Preview**: Display the next tetromino that will fall.\n",
      "- **Controls Display**: Provide a reference for player controls (instructions on how to play and activate power-ups).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4.2 Animations\n",
      "- **Falling Tetrominoes**: Smooth dropping animations as tetrominoes move down.\n",
      "- **Gem Transformations**: Visual effects for transforming tetrominoes into gems.\n",
      "- **Clearing Effects**: Animate the process of clearing matched gems, with visual cues to signal successful actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. Additional Features\n",
      "- **Difficulty Scaling**: Increase speed and frequency of tetromino drops as the score rises.\n",
      "- **Power-ups**: Implement special gems that can clear larger areas or all gems of a color; these should be visually distinct to make them noticeable.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 6. Implementation Framework\n",
      "- **Game Development Framework**: Use Pygame for rendering, input handling, and animations.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 7. Development Plan\n",
      "1. Create the grid and implement tetromino spawning and locking logic.\n",
      "2. Implement gem transformation and line clearing.\n",
      "3. Integrate interaction mechanics with gem matching post-tetromino lock.\n",
      "4. Develop match-3 detection and clearing mechanisms.\n",
      "5. Design and implement the GUI components, including control instructions.\n",
      "6. Integrate animations for a smooth player experience with feedback.\n",
      "7. Test and refine gameplay mechanics for balance. \n",

      "### 1. Gem Matching\n",
      "- Define a function `check_for_matches(grid)` that scans the grid for groups of three or more adjacent gems of the same color both horizontally and vertically.\n",
      "- Use a nested loop to iterate through each cell in the grid, checking horizontal and vertical sequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Clearing Gems\n",
      "- Upon detecting a match, create a list of all gem positions that are part of the match.\n",
      "- Define a function `clear_gems(grid, matches)` to remove these gems from the grid and set their positions to a placeholder (e.g., `None`).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Cascading Effects\n",
      "- After clearing gems, define a function `cascade_gems(grid)` that shifts all remaining gems down to fill the empty spaces.\n",
      "- This function should also check for new matches that result from the cascading and call the `clear_gems` function if new matches are found recursively.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Score Update\n",
      "- Maintain a scoring system to increment the score when gems are cleared. Define a function `update_score(num_cleared)` to calculate and update the score based on the number of gems cleared. Include bonus multipliers for cascade chains.\n",
      "  \n",
      "### 5. Integration with Tetromino Lock\n",
      "- Modify the tetromino lock logic to call `check_for_matches(grid)` immediately after a tetromino locks in place.\n",
      "- If matches are found, either call `clear_gems`, followed by `cascade_gems`, updating the score accordingly with `update_score`.\n",

      "- **Locking Mechanism**: When a tetromino cannot move down further, it locks into the grid, transforming into gems.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2.2 Grid Interaction\n",
      "- **Line Clearing**: Check for complete rows; remove completed rows and shift everything above down.\n",
      "- **Transformation**: Upon locking, convert locked tetrominoes into random colored gems.\n",
      "- **Interaction with Gems**: If a tetromino locks in a position that creates an adjacent gem formation, immediately trigger the gem matching mechanics.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. Match-3 Mechanics (Overview)\n",
      "- **Gem Matching**: Check for groups of three or more adjacent gems of the same color.\n",
      "- **Clearing Gems**: Remove matched gems and trigger cascading clears if new matches occur.\n",
      "- **Cascading Effects**: After a tetromino locks, if a matching area occurs, it should trigger a clear and may lead to another score increment based on chain reactions.\n",
      "- **Score Update**: Increment the score based on the number of cleared gems and any consequential chains.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. User Interface (GUI)\n",
      "### 4.1 Layout\n",
      "- **Game Grid Display**: Render the grid and current state (tetrominoes and gems).\n",
      "- **Score Display**: Show current score prominently on the screen.\n",
      "- **Next Tetromino Preview**: Display the next tetromino that will fall.\n",
      "- **Controls Display**: Provide a reference for player controls (instructions on how to play and activate power-ups).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4.2 Animations\n",
      "- **Falling Tetrominoes**: Smooth dropping animations as tetrominoes move down.\n",
      "- **Gem Transformations**: Visual effects for transforming tetrominoes into gems.\n",
      "- **Clearing Effects**: Animate the process of clearing matched gems, with visual cues to signal successful actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. Additional Features\n",
      "- **Difficulty Scaling**: Increase speed and frequency of tetromino drops as the score rises.\n",
      "- **Power-ups**: Implement special gems that can clear larger areas or all gems of a color; these should be visually distinct to make them noticeable.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 6. Implementation Framework\n",
      "- **Game Development Framework**: Use Pygame for rendering, input handling, and animations.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 7. Development Plan\n",
      "1. Create the grid and implement tetromino spawning and locking logic.\n",
      "2. Implement gem transformation and line clearing.\n",
      "3. Integrate interaction mechanics with gem matching post-tetromino lock.\n",
      "4. Develop match-3 detection and clearing mechanisms.\n",
      "5. Design and implement the GUI components, including control instructions.\n",
      "6. Integrate animations for a smooth player experience with feedback.\n",
      "7. Test and refine gameplay mechanics for balance. \n",
      "\n",
      "This architecture serves as a foundational blueprint for development, guiding modular implementation of core features and interactions within the game, while ensuring clarity and player engagement.\n",

      "## Match-3 Mechanics Implementation\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Gem Matching\n",
      "- Define a function `check_for_matches(grid)` that scans the grid for groups of three or more adjacent gems of the same color both horizontally and vertically.\n",
      "- Use a nested loop to iterate through each cell in the grid, checking horizontal and vertical sequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Clearing Gems\n",
      "- Upon detecting a match, create a list of all gem positions that are part of the match.\n",
      "- Define a function `clear_gems(grid, matches)` to remove these gems from the grid and set their positions to `None`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Cascading Effects\n",
      "- After clearing gems, define a function `cascade_gems(grid)` that shifts all remaining gems down to fill the empty spaces.\n",
      "- This function should also check for new matches that result from the cascading and call the `clear_gems` function if new matches are found recursively.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Score Update\n",
      "- Maintain a scoring system to increment the score when gems are cleared. Define a function `update_score(current_score, num_cleared)` to calculate and return the new score based on the number of gems cleared, including bonuses for cascade chains.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. Integration with Tetromino Lock\n",
      "- Modify the tetromino lock logic to call `check_for_matches(grid)` immediately after a tetromino locks in place.\n",
      "- If matches are found, call `clear_gems`, followed by `cascade_gems`, and update the score using `update_score`.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "## 1. Game Components\n",
      "- **Grid**: A 2D array representing the game area (e.g., 10 columns x 20 rows).\n",
      "- **Tetrominoes**: Various shapes (I, O, T, S, Z, J, L) that can fall and occupy grid spaces.\n",
      "- **Gems**: Colored blocks representing the transformed tetrominoes after locking.\n",
      "- **Score System**: Tracks the player's score, updating for line clears and gem matches.\n",
      "- **Game States**: Main menu, playing, paused, and game over states.\n",
      "- **Controls**: Player controls for moving (left, right, down), rotating tetrominoes, and initiating special gem powers.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. Game Logic\n",
      "### 2.1 Tetromino Management\n",
      "- **Spawn**: Randomly generate a tetromino at the top of the grid.\n",
      "- **Movement**: Control tetromino movement (left, right, down) and rotation.\n",
      "- **Locking Mechanism**: When a tetromino cannot move down further, it locks into the grid, transforming into gems.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2.2 Grid Interaction\n",
      "- **Line Clearing**: Check for complete rows; remove completed rows and shift everything above down.\n",
      "- **Transformation**: Upon locking, convert locked tetrominoes into random colored gems.\n",
      "- **Interaction with Gems**: If a tetromino locks in a position that creates an adjacent gem formation, immediately trigger the gem matching mechanics.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. Match-3 Mechanics (Overview)\n",
      "- **Gem Matching**: Check for groups of three or more adjacent gems of the same color.\n",
      "- **Clearing Gems**: Remove matched gems and trigger cascading clears if new matches occur.\n",
      "- **Cascading Effects**: After a tetromino locks, if a matching area occurs, it should trigger a clear and may lead to another score increment based on chain reactions.\n",
      "- **Score Update**: Increment the score based on the number of cleared gems and any consequential chains.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. User Interface (GUI)\n",
      "### 4.1 Layout\n",
      "- **Game Grid Display**: Render the grid and current state (tetrominoes and gems).\n",
      "- **Score Display**: Show current score prominently on the screen.\n",
      "- **Next Tetromino Preview**: Display the next tetromino that will fall.\n",
      "- **Controls Display**: Provide a reference for player controls (instructions on how to play and activate power-ups).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4.2 Animations\n",
      "- **Falling Tetrominoes**: Smooth dropping animations as tetrominoes move down.\n",
      "- **Gem Transformations**: Visual effects for transforming tetrominoes into gems.\n",
      "- **Clearing Effects**: Animate the process of clearing matched gems, with visual cues to signal successful actions.\n",
      "\n",

      "### 1. Gem Matching\n",
      "- Define a function `check_for_matches(grid)` that scans the grid for groups of three or more adjacent gems of the same color both horizontally and vertically.\n",
      "- Use a nested loop to iterate through each cell in the grid, checking horizontal and vertical sequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Clearing Gems\n",
      "- Upon detecting a match, create a list of all gem positions that are part of the match.\n",
      "- Define a function `clear_gems(grid, matches)` to remove these gems from the grid and set their positions to a placeholder (e.g., `None`).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Cascading Effects\n",
      "- After clearing gems, define a function `cascade_gems(grid)` that shifts all remaining gems down to fill the empty spaces.\n",
      "- This function should also check for new matches that result from the cascading and call the `clear_gems` function if new matches are found recursively.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Score Update\n",
      "- Maintain a scoring system to increment the score when gems are cleared. Define a function `update_score(num_cleared)` to calculate and update the score based on the number of gems cleared. Include bonus multipliers for cascade chains.\n",
      "  \n",
      "### 5. Integration with Tetromino Lock\n",
      "- Modify the tetromino lock logic to call `check_for_matches(grid)` immediately after a tetromino locks in place.\n",
      "- If matches are found, either call `clear_gems`, followed by `cascade_gems`, updating the score accordingly with `update_score`.\n",

      "\n",
      "### 1. Gem Matching\n",
      "- Define a function `check_for_matches(grid)` that scans the grid for groups of three or more adjacent gems of the same color both horizontally and vertically. Utilize a nested loop to traverse through each cell in the grid, checking sequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Clearing Gems\n",
      "- Upon detecting a match, gather the positions of all matching gems. Define a function `clear_gems(grid, matches)` to remove these gems from the grid and assign their positions to `None`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Cascading Effects\n",
      "- After clearing gems, create a function `cascade_gems(grid)` to shift remaining gems down to fill empty spaces. This function should also check for any new matches formed from the cascading and invoke `clear_gems` if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Score Update\n",
      "- Implement a scoring system to increment the current score based on cleared gems. Define a function `update_score(current_score, num_cleared)` that returns the updated score, including bonuses for cascading clears.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. Integration with Tetromino Lock\n",
      "- Modify the tetromino lock logic to call `check_for_matches(grid)` immediately after a tetromino locks in place. If matches are discovered, call `clear_gems`, then `cascade_gems`, followed by updating the score with `update_score`.\n",

      "  Result: # Game Architecture Design for Tetris-Bejeweled Fusion\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. Game Components\n",
      "- **Grid**: A 2D array representing the game area (e.g., 10 columns x 20 rows).\n",
      "- **Tetrominoes**: Various shapes (I, O, T, S, Z, J, L) that can fall and occupy grid spaces.\n",
      "- **Gems**: Colored blocks representing the transformed tetrominoes after locking.\n",
      "- **Score System**: Tracks the player's score, updating for line clears and gem matches.\n",
      "- **Game States**: Main menu, playing, paused, and game over states.\n",
      "- **Controls**: Player controls for moving (left, right, down), rotating tetrominoes, and initiating special gem powers.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. Game Logic\n",
      "### 2.1 Tetromino Management\n",
      "- **Spawn**: Randomly generate a tetromino at the top of the grid.\n",
      "- **Movement**: Control tetromino movement (left, right, down) and rotation.\n",
      "- **Locking Mechanism**: When a tetromino cannot move down further, it locks into the grid, transforming into gems.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2.2 Grid Interaction\n",
      "- **Line Clearing**: Check for complete rows; remove completed rows and shift everything above down.\n",
      "- **Transformation**: Upon locking, convert locked tetrominoes into random colored gems.\n",
      "- **Interaction with Gems**: If a tetromino locks in a position that creates an adjacent gem formation, immediately trigger the gem matching mechanics.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. Match-3 Mechanics (Overview)\n",
      "- **Gem Matching**: Check for groups of three or more adjacent gems of the same color.\n",
      "- **Clearing Gems**: Remove matched gems and trigger cascading clears if new matches occur.\n",
      "- **Cascading Effects**: After a tetromino locks, if a matching area occurs, it should trigger a clear and may lead to another score increment based on chain reactions.\n",
      "- **Score Update**: Increment the score based on the number of cleared gems and any consequential chains.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. User Interface (GUI)\n",
      "### 4.1 Layout\n",
      "- **Game Grid Display**: Render the grid and current state (tetrominoes and gems).\n",
      "- **Score Display**: Show current score prominently on the screen.\n",
      "- **Next Tetromino Preview**: Display the next tetromino that will fall.\n",
      "- **Controls Display**: Provide a reference for player controls (instructions on how to play and activate power-ups).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4.2 Animations\n",
      "- **Falling Tetrominoes**: Smooth dropping animations as tetrominoes move down.\n",
      "- **Gem Transformations**: Visual effects for transforming tetrominoes into gems.\n",
      "- **Clearing Effects**: Animate the process of clearing matched gems, with visual cues to signal successful actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. Additional Features\n",
      "- **Difficulty Scaling**: Increase speed and frequency of tetromino drops as the score rises.\n",
      "- **Power-ups**: Implement special gems that can clear larger areas or all gems of a color; these should be visually distinct to make them noticeable.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 6. Implementation Framework\n",
      "- **Game Development Framework**: Use Pygame for rendering, input handling, and animations.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 7. Development Plan\n",
      "1. Create the grid and implement tetromino spawning and locking logic.\n",
      "2. Implement gem transformation and line clearing.\n",
      "3. Integrate interaction mechanics with gem matching post-tetromino lock.\n",
      "4. Develop match-3 detection and clearing mechanisms.\n",
      "5. Design and implement the GUI components, including control instructions.\n",
      "6. Integrate animations for a smooth player experience with feedback.\n",
      "7. Test and refine gameplay mechanics for balance. \n",
      "\n",

      "### 1. Gem Matching\n",
      "- Define a function `check_for_matches(grid)` that scans the grid for groups of three or more adjacent gems of the same color both horizontally and vertically.\n",
      "- Use a nested loop to iterate through each cell in the grid, checking horizontal and vertical sequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Clearing Gems\n",
      "- Upon detecting a match, create a list of all gem positions that are part of the match.\n",
      "- Define a function `clear_gems(grid, matches)` to remove these gems from the grid and set their positions to `None`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Cascading Effects\n",
      "- After clearing gems, define a function `cascade_gems(grid)` that shifts all remaining gems down to fill the empty spaces.\n",

      "\n",
      "### 4. Score Update\n",
      "- Maintain a scoring system to increment the score when gems are cleared. Define a function `update_score(current_score, num_cleared)` to calculate and return the new score based on the number of gems cleared, including bonuses for cascade chains.\n",

      "## Match-3 Mechanics Implementation\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Gem Matching\n",
      "- Define a function `check_for_matches(grid)` that scans the grid for groups of three or more adjacent gems of the same color both horizontally and vertically. Utilize a nested loop to traverse through each cell in the grid, checking sequences.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Clearing Gems\n",
      "- Upon detecting a match, gather the positions of all matching gems. Define a function `clear_gems(grid, matches)` to remove these gems from the grid and assign their positions to `None`.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Cascading Effects\n",
      "- After clearing gems, create a function `cascade_gems(grid)` to shift remaining gems down to fill empty spaces. This function should also check for any new matches formed from the cascading and invoke `clear_gems` if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Score Update\n",
      "- Implement a scoring system to increment the current score based on cleared gems. Define a function `update_score(current_score, num_cleared)` that returns the updated score, including bonuses for cascading clears.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. Integration with Tetromino Lock\n",
      "- Modify the tetromino lock logic to call `check_for_matches(grid)` immediately after a tetromino locks in place. If matches are discovered, call `clear_gems`, then `cascade_gems`, followed by updating the score with `update_score`.\n",

      "  Result: # Game Architecture Design for Tetris-Bejeweled Fusion\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. Game Components\n",
      "- **Grid**: A 2D array representing the game area (e.g., 10 columns x 20 rows).\n",
      "- **Tetrominoes**: Various shapes (I, O, T, S, Z, J, L) that can fall and occupy grid spaces.\n",
      "- **Gems**: Colored blocks representing the transformed tetrominoes after locking.\n",
      "- **Score System**: Tracks the player's score, updating for line clears and gem matches.\n",
      "- **Game States**: Main menu, playing, paused, and game over states.\n",
      "- **Controls**: Player controls for moving (left, right, down), rotating tetrominoes, and initiating special gem powers.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. Game Logic\n",
      "### 2.1 Tetromino Management\n",
      "- **Spawn**: Randomly generate a tetromino at the top of the grid.\n",
      "- **Movement**: Control tetromino movement (left, right, down) and rotation.\n",
      "- **Locking Mechanism**: When a tetromino cannot move down further, it locks into the grid, transforming into gems.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2.2 Grid Interaction\n",
      "- **Line Clearing**: Check for complete rows; remove completed rows and shift everything above down.\n",
      "- **Transformation**: Upon locking, convert locked tetrominoes into random colored gems.\n",
      "- **Interaction with Gems**: If a tetromino locks in a position that creates an adjacent gem formation, immediately trigger the gem matching mechanics.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. Match-3 Mechanics (Overview)\n",
      "- **Gem Matching**: Check for groups of three or more adjacent gems of the same color.\n",
      "- **Clearing Gems**: Remove matched gems and trigger cascading clears if new matches occur.\n",
      "- **Cascading Effects**: After a tetromino locks, if a matching area occurs, it should trigger a clear and may lead to another score increment based on chain reactions.\n",
      "- **Score Update**: Increment the score based on the number of cleared gems and any consequential chains.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. User Interface (GUI)\n",
      "### 4.1 Layout\n",
      "- **Game Grid Display**: Render the grid and current state (tetrominoes and gems).\n",
      "- **Score Display**: Show current score prominently on the screen.\n",
      "- **Next Tetromino Preview**: Display the next tetromino that will fall.\n",
      "- **Controls Display**: Provide a reference for player controls (instructions on how to play and activate power-ups).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4.2 Animations\n",
      "- **Falling Tetrominoes**: Smooth dropping animations as tetrominoes move down.\n",
      "- **Gem Transformations**: Visual effects for transforming tetrominoes into gems.\n",
      "- **Clearing Effects**: Animate the process of clearing matched gems, with visual cues to signal successful actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. Additional Features\n",
      "- **Difficulty Scaling**: Increase speed and frequency of tetromino drops as the score rises.\n",
      "- **Power-ups**: Implement special gems that can clear larger areas or all gems of a color; these should be visually distinct to make them noticeable.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 6. Implementation Framework\n",
      "- **Game Development Framework**: Use Pygame for rendering, input handling, and animations.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 7. Development Plan\n",
      "1. Create the grid and implement tetromino spawning and locking logic.\n",
      "2. Implement gem transformation and line clearing.\n",
      "3. Integrate interaction mechanics with gem matching post-tetromino lock.\n",
      "4. Develop match-3 detection and clearing mechanisms.\n",
      "5. Design and implement the GUI components, including control instructions.\n",
      "6. Integrate animations for a smooth player experience with feedback.\n",
      "7. Test and refine gameplay mechanics for balance. \n",

      "The game must support both Tetris line-clearing and Bejeweled match-3 clearing, triggering chain reactions and bonus points. \n",
      "Include a GUI (using a framework like Pygame) that displays the game grid, current score, and next tetromino preview, along with smooth animations.\n",

      "# **Context from Upstream Tasks**\n",
      "Task task0:\n",
      "  Objective: Design the overall game architecture, including the fusion of Tetris and Bejeweled mechanics.\n",
      "  Result: # Game Architecture Design for Tetris-Bejeweled Fusion\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. Game Components\n",
      "- **Grid**: A 2D array representing the game area (e.g., 10 columns x 20 rows).\n",
      "- **Tetrominoes**: Various shapes (I, O, T, S, Z, J, L) that can fall and occupy grid spaces.\n",
      "- **Gems**: Colored blocks representing the transformed tetrominoes after locking.\n",
      "- **Score System**: Tracks the player's score, updating for line clears and gem matches.\n",
      "- **Game States**: Main menu, playing, paused, and game over states.\n",
      "- **Controls**: Player controls for moving (left, right, down), rotating tetrominoes, and initiating special gem powers.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. Game Logic\n",
      "### 2.1 Tetromino Management\n",
      "- **Spawn**: Randomly generate a tetromino at the top of the grid.\n",
      "- **Movement**: Control tetromino movement (left, right, down) and rotation.\n",
      "- **Locking Mechanism**: When a tetromino cannot move down further, it locks into the grid, transforming into gems.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2.2 Grid Interaction\n",
      "- **Line Clearing**: Check for complete rows; remove completed rows and shift everything above down.\n",
      "- **Transformation**: Upon locking, convert locked tetrominoes into random colored gems.\n",
      "- **Interaction with Gems**: If a tetromino locks in a position that creates an adjacent gem formation, immediately trigger the gem matching mechanics.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. Match-3 Mechanics (Overview)\n",
      "- **Gem Matching**: Check for groups of three or more adjacent gems of the same color.\n",
      "- **Clearing Gems**: Remove matched gems and trigger cascading clears if new matches occur.\n",
      "- **Cascading Effects**: After a tetromino locks, if a matching area occurs, it should trigger a clear and may lead to another score increment based on chain reactions.\n",
      "- **Score Update**: Increment the score based on the number of cleared gems and any consequential chains.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. User Interface (GUI)\n",
      "### 4.1 Layout\n",
      "- **Game Grid Display**: Render the grid and current state (tetrominoes and gems).\n",
      "- **Score Display**: Show current score prominently on the screen.\n",
      "- **Next Tetromino Preview**: Display the next tetromino that will fall.\n",
      "- **Controls Display**: Provide a reference for player controls (instructions on how to play and activate power-ups).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4.2 Animations\n",
      "- **Falling Tetrominoes**: Smooth dropping animations as tetrominoes move down.\n",
      "- **Gem Transformations**: Visual effects for transforming tetrominoes into gems.\n",
      "- **Clearing Effects**: Animate the process of clearing matched gems, with visual cues to signal successful actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. Additional Features\n",
      "- **Difficulty Scaling**: Increase speed and frequency of tetromino drops as the score rises.\n",
      "- **Power-ups**: Implement special gems that can clear larger areas or all gems of a color; these should be visually distinct to make them noticeable.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 6. Implementation Framework\n",
      "- **Game Development Framework**: Use Pygame for rendering, input handling, and animations.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 7. Development Plan\n",
      "1. Create the grid and implement tetromino spawning and locking logic.\n",
      "2. Implement gem transformation and line clearing.\n",
      "3. Integrate interaction mechanics with gem matching post-tetromino lock.\n",
      "4. Develop match-3 detection and clearing mechanisms.\n",
      "5. Design and implement the GUI components, including control instructions.\n",
      "6. Integrate animations for a smooth player experience with feedback.\n",
      "7. Test and refine gameplay mechanics for balance. \n",
      "\n",
      "This architecture serves as a foundational blueprint for development, guiding modular implementation of core features and interactions within the game, while ensuring clarity and player engagement.\n",

      "Develop a game that fuses Tetris and Bejeweled mechanics. \n",
      "Falling tetrominoes should lock into a grid and transform into colored gems. \n",
      "The game must support both Tetris line-clearing and Bejeweled match-3 clearing, triggering chain reactions and bonus points. \n",
      "Include a GUI (using a framework like Pygame) that displays the game grid, current score, and next tetromino preview, along with smooth animations.\n",

      "# **Context from Upstream Tasks**\n",
      "Task task0:\n",
      "  Objective: Design the overall game architecture, including the fusion of Tetris and Bejeweled mechanics.\n",
      "  Result: # Game Architecture Design for Tetris-Bejeweled Fusion\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. Game Components\n",
      "- **Grid**: A 2D array representing the game area (e.g., 10 columns x 20 rows).\n",
      "- **Tetrominoes**: Various shapes (I, O, T, S, Z, J, L) that can fall and occupy grid spaces.\n",
      "- **Gems**: Colored blocks representing the transformed tetrominoes after locking.\n",
      "- **Score System**: Tracks the player's score, updating for line clears and gem matches.\n",
      "- **Game States**: Main menu, playing, paused, and game over states.\n",
      "- **Controls**: Player controls for moving (left, right, down), rotating tetrominoes, and initiating special gem powers.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. Game Logic\n",
      "### 2.1 Tetromino Management\n",
      "- **Spawn**: Randomly generate a tetromino at the top of the grid.\n",
      "- **Movement**: Control tetromino movement (left, right, down) and rotation.\n",
      "- **Locking Mechanism**: When a tetromino cannot move down further, it locks into the grid, transforming into gems.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2.2 Grid Interaction\n",
      "- **Line Clearing**: Check for complete rows; remove completed rows and shift everything above down.\n",
      "- **Transformation**: Upon locking, convert locked tetrominoes into random colored gems.\n",
      "- **Interaction with Gems**: If a tetromino locks in a position that creates an adjacent gem formation, immediately trigger the gem matching mechanics.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. Match-3 Mechanics (Overview)\n",
      "- **Gem Matching**: Check for groups of three or more adjacent gems of the same color.\n",
      "- **Clearing Gems**: Remove matched gems and trigger cascading clears if new matches occur.\n",
      "- **Cascading Effects**: After a tetromino locks, if a matching area occurs, it should trigger a clear and may lead to another score increment based on chain reactions.\n",
      "- **Score Update**: Increment the score based on the number of cleared gems and any consequential chains.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. User Interface (GUI)\n",
      "### 4.1 Layout\n",
      "- **Game Grid Display**: Render the grid and current state (tetrominoes and gems).\n",
      "- **Score Display**: Show current score prominently on the screen.\n",
      "- **Next Tetromino Preview**: Display the next tetromino that will fall.\n",
      "- **Controls Display**: Provide a reference for player controls (instructions on how to play and activate power-ups).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4.2 Animations\n",
      "- **Falling Tetrominoes**: Smooth dropping animations as tetrominoes move down.\n",
      "- **Gem Transformations**: Visual effects for transforming tetrominoes into gems.\n",
      "- **Clearing Effects**: Animate the process of clearing matched gems, with visual cues to signal successful actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. Additional Features\n",
      "- **Difficulty Scaling**: Increase speed and frequency of tetromino drops as the score rises.\n",
      "- **Power-ups**: Implement special gems that can clear larger areas or all gems of a color; these should be visually distinct to make them noticeable.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 6. Implementation Framework\n",
      "- **Game Development Framework**: Use Pygame for rendering, input handling, and animations.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 7. Development Plan\n",
      "1. Create the grid and implement tetromino spawning and locking logic.\n",
      "2. Implement gem transformation and line clearing.\n",
      "3. Integrate interaction mechanics with gem matching post-tetromino lock.\n",
      "4. Develop match-3 detection and clearing mechanisms.\n",
      "5. Design and implement the GUI components, including control instructions.\n",
      "6. Integrate animations for a smooth player experience with feedback.\n",
      "7. Test and refine gameplay mechanics for balance. \n",
      "\n",
      "This architecture serves as a foundational blueprint for development, guiding modular implementation of core features and interactions within the game, while ensuring clarity and player engagement.\n",

      "# **Context from Upstream Tasks**\n",
      "Task task0:\n",
      "  Objective: Design the overall game architecture, including the fusion of Tetris and Bejeweled mechanics.\n",
      "  Result: # Game Architecture Design for Tetris-Bejeweled Fusion\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. Game Components\n",
      "- **Grid**: A 2D array representing the game area (e.g., 10 columns x 20 rows).\n",
      "- **Tetrominoes**: Various shapes (I, O, T, S, Z, J, L) that can fall and occupy grid spaces.\n",
      "- **Gems**: Colored blocks representing the transformed tetrominoes after locking.\n",
      "- **Score System**: Tracks the player's score, updating for line clears and gem matches.\n",
      "- **Game States**: Main menu, playing, paused, and game over states.\n",
      "- **Controls**: Player controls for moving (left, right, down), rotating tetrominoes, and initiating special gem powers.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. Game Logic\n",
      "### 2.1 Tetromino Management\n",
      "- **Spawn**: Randomly generate a tetromino at the top of the grid.\n",
      "- **Movement**: Control tetromino movement (left, right, down) and rotation.\n",
      "- **Locking Mechanism**: When a tetromino cannot move down further, it locks into the grid, transforming into gems.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2.2 Grid Interaction\n",
      "- **Line Clearing**: Check for complete rows; remove completed rows and shift everything above down.\n",
      "- **Transformation**: Upon locking, convert locked tetrominoes into random colored gems.\n",
      "- **Interaction with Gems**: If a tetromino locks in a position that creates an adjacent gem formation, immediately trigger the gem matching mechanics.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. Match-3 Mechanics (Overview)\n",
      "- **Gem Matching**: Check for groups of three or more adjacent gems of the same color.\n",
      "- **Clearing Gems**: Remove matched gems and trigger cascading clears if new matches occur.\n",
      "- **Cascading Effects**: After a tetromino locks, if a matching area occurs, it should trigger a clear and may lead to another score increment based on chain reactions.\n",
      "- **Score Update**: Increment the score based on the number of cleared gems and any consequential chains.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. User Interface (GUI)\n",
      "### 4.1 Layout\n",
      "- **Game Grid Display**: Render the grid and current state (tetrominoes and gems).\n",
      "- **Score Display**: Show current score prominently on the screen.\n",
      "- **Next Tetromino Preview**: Display the next tetromino that will fall.\n",
      "- **Controls Display**: Provide a reference for player controls (instructions on how to play and activate power-ups).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4.2 Animations\n",
      "- **Falling Tetrominoes**: Smooth dropping animations as tetrominoes move down.\n",
      "- **Gem Transformations**: Visual effects for transforming tetrominoes into gems.\n",
      "- **Clearing Effects**: Animate the process of clearing matched gems, with visual cues to signal successful actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. Additional Features\n",
      "- **Difficulty Scaling**: Increase speed and frequency of tetromino drops as the score rises.\n",
      "- **Power-ups**: Implement special gems that can clear larger areas or all gems of a color; these should be visually distinct to make them noticeable.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 6. Implementation Framework\n",
      "- **Game Development Framework**: Use Pygame for rendering, input handling, and animations.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 7. Development Plan\n",
      "1. Create the grid and implement tetromino spawning and locking logic.\n",
      "2. Implement gem transformation and line clearing.\n",
      "3. Integrate interaction mechanics with gem matching post-tetromino lock.\n",
      "4. Develop match-3 detection and clearing mechanisms.\n",
      "5. Design and implement the GUI components, including control instructions.\n",
      "6. Integrate animations for a smooth player experience with feedback.\n",
      "7. Test and refine gameplay mechanics for balance. \n",
      "\n",
      "This architecture serves as a foundational blueprint for development, guiding modular implementation of core features and interactions within the game, while ensuring clarity and player engagement.\n",

      "  Result: # Game Architecture Design for Tetris-Bejeweled Fusion\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. Game Components\n",
      "- **Grid**: A 2D array representing the game area (e.g., 10 columns x 20 rows).\n",
      "- **Tetrominoes**: Various shapes (I, O, T, S, Z, J, L) that can fall and occupy grid spaces.\n",
      "- **Gems**: Colored blocks representing the transformed tetrominoes after locking.\n",
      "- **Score System**: Tracks the player's score, updating for line clears and gem matches.\n",
      "- **Game States**: Main menu, playing, paused, and game over states.\n",
      "- **Controls**: Player controls for moving (left, right, down), rotating tetrominoes, and initiating special gem powers.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. Game Logic\n",
      "### 2.1 Tetromino Management\n",
      "- **Spawn**: Randomly generate a tetromino at the top of the grid.\n",
      "- **Movement**: Control tetromino movement (left, right, down) and rotation.\n",
      "- **Locking Mechanism**: When a tetromino cannot move down further, it locks into the grid, transforming into gems.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2.2 Grid Interaction\n",
      "- **Line Clearing**: Check for complete rows; remove completed rows and shift everything above down.\n",
      "- **Transformation**: Upon locking, convert locked tetrominoes into random colored gems.\n",
      "- **Interaction with Gems**: If a tetromino locks in a position that creates an adjacent gem formation, immediately trigger the gem matching mechanics.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. Match-3 Mechanics (Overview)\n",
      "- **Gem Matching**: Check for groups of three or more adjacent gems of the same color.\n",
      "- **Clearing Gems**: Remove matched gems and trigger cascading clears if new matches occur.\n",
      "- **Cascading Effects**: After a tetromino locks, if a matching area occurs, it should trigger a clear and may lead to another score increment based on chain reactions.\n",
      "- **Score Update**: Increment the score based on the number of cleared gems and any consequential chains.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. User Interface (GUI)\n",
      "### 4.1 Layout\n",
      "- **Game Grid Display**: Render the grid and current state (tetrominoes and gems).\n",
      "- **Score Display**: Show current score prominently on the screen.\n",
      "- **Next Tetromino Preview**: Display the next tetromino that will fall.\n",
      "- **Controls Display**: Provide a reference for player controls (instructions on how to play and activate power-ups).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4.2 Animations\n",
      "- **Falling Tetrominoes**: Smooth dropping animations as tetrominoes move down.\n",
      "- **Gem Transformations**: Visual effects for transforming tetrominoes into gems.\n",
      "- **Clearing Effects**: Animate the process of clearing matched gems, with visual cues to signal successful actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. Additional Features\n",
      "- **Difficulty Scaling**: Increase speed and frequency of tetromino drops as the score rises.\n",
      "- **Power-ups**: Implement special gems that can clear larger areas or all gems of a color; these should be visually distinct to make them noticeable.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 6. Implementation Framework\n",
      "- **Game Development Framework**: Use Pygame for rendering, input handling, and animations.\n",

      "## 7. Development Plan\n",
      "1. Create the grid and implement tetromino spawning and locking logic.\n",
      "2. Implement gem transformation and line clearing.\n",
      "3. Integrate interaction mechanics with gem matching post-tetromino lock.\n",
      "4. Develop match-3 detection and clearing mechanisms.\n",
      "5. Design and implement the GUI components, including control instructions.\n",

      "Task task0:\n",
      "  Objective: Design the overall game architecture, including the fusion of Tetris and Bejeweled mechanics.\n",
      "  Result: # Game Architecture Design for Tetris-Bejeweled Fusion\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. Game Components\n",
      "- **Grid**: A 2D array representing the game area (e.g., 10 columns x 20 rows).\n",
      "- **Tetrominoes**: Various shapes (I, O, T, S, Z, J, L) that can fall and occupy grid spaces.\n",
      "- **Gems**: Colored blocks representing the transformed tetrominoes after locking.\n",
      "- **Score System**: Tracks the player's score, updating for line clears and gem matches.\n",
      "- **Game States**: Main menu, playing, paused, and game over states.\n",
      "- **Controls**: Player controls for moving (left, right, down), rotating tetrominoes, and initiating special gem powers.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. Game Logic\n",
      "### 2.1 Tetromino Management\n",
      "- **Spawn**: Randomly generate a tetromino at the top of the grid.\n",
      "- **Movement**: Control tetromino movement (left, right, down) and rotation.\n",
      "- **Locking Mechanism**: When a tetromino cannot move down further, it locks into the grid, transforming into gems.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2.2 Grid Interaction\n",
      "- **Line Clearing**: Check for complete rows; remove completed rows and shift everything above down.\n",
      "- **Transformation**: Upon locking, convert locked tetrominoes into random colored gems.\n",
      "- **Interaction with Gems**: If a tetromino locks in a position that creates an adjacent gem formation, immediately trigger the gem matching mechanics.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. Match-3 Mechanics (Overview)\n",
      "- **Gem Matching**: Check for groups of three or more adjacent gems of the same color.\n",
      "- **Clearing Gems**: Remove matched gems and trigger cascading clears if new matches occur.\n",
      "- **Cascading Effects**: After a tetromino locks, if a matching area occurs, it should trigger a clear and may lead to another score increment based on chain reactions.\n",
      "- **Score Update**: Increment the score based on the number of cleared gems and any consequential chains.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. User Interface (GUI)\n",
      "### 4.1 Layout\n",
      "- **Game Grid Display**: Render the grid and current state (tetrominoes and gems).\n",
      "- **Score Display**: Show current score prominently on the screen.\n",
      "- **Next Tetromino Preview**: Display the next tetromino that will fall.\n",
      "- **Controls Display**: Provide a reference for player controls (instructions on how to play and activate power-ups).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4.2 Animations\n",
      "- **Falling Tetrominoes**: Smooth dropping animations as tetrominoes move down.\n",
      "- **Gem Transformations**: Visual effects for transforming tetrominoes into gems.\n",
      "- **Clearing Effects**: Animate the process of clearing matched gems, with visual cues to signal successful actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. Additional Features\n",
      "- **Difficulty Scaling**: Increase speed and frequency of tetromino drops as the score rises.\n",
      "- **Power-ups**: Implement special gems that can clear larger areas or all gems of a color; these should be visually distinct to make them noticeable.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 6. Implementation Framework\n",
      "- **Game Development Framework**: Use Pygame for rendering, input handling, and animations.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 7. Development Plan\n",
      "1. Create the grid and implement tetromino spawning and locking logic.\n",
      "2. Implement gem transformation and line clearing.\n",
      "3. Integrate interaction mechanics with gem matching post-tetromino lock.\n",
      "4. Develop match-3 detection and clearing mechanisms.\n",
      "5. Design and implement the GUI components, including control instructions.\n",
      "6. Integrate animations for a smooth player experience with feedback.\n",
      "7. Test and refine gameplay mechanics for balance. \n",
      "\n",
      "This architecture serves as a foundational blueprint for development, guiding modular implementation of core features and interactions within the game, while ensuring clarity and player engagement.\n",

      "The game must support both Tetris line-clearing and Bejeweled match-3 clearing, triggering chain reactions and bonus points. \n",
      "Include a GUI (using a framework like Pygame) that displays the game grid, current score, and next tetromino preview, along with smooth animations.\n",

      "# **Context from Upstream Tasks**\n",
      "Task task0:\n",
      "  Objective: Design the overall game architecture, including the fusion of Tetris and Bejeweled mechanics.\n",
      "  Result: # Game Architecture Design for Tetris-Bejeweled Fusion\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. Game Components\n",
      "- **Grid**: A 2D array representing the game area (e.g., 10 columns x 20 rows).\n",
      "- **Tetrominoes**: Various shapes (I, O, T, S, Z, J, L) that can fall and occupy grid spaces.\n",
      "- **Gems**: Colored blocks representing the transformed tetrominoes after locking.\n",
      "- **Score System**: Tracks the player's score, updating for line clears and gem matches.\n",
      "- **Game States**: Main menu, playing, paused, and game over states.\n",
      "- **Controls**: Player controls for moving (left, right, down), rotating tetrominoes, and initiating special gem powers.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. Game Logic\n",
      "### 2.1 Tetromino Management\n",
      "- **Spawn**: Randomly generate a tetromino at the top of the grid.\n",
      "- **Movement**: Control tetromino movement (left, right, down) and rotation.\n",
      "- **Locking Mechanism**: When a tetromino cannot move down further, it locks into the grid, transforming into gems.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2.2 Grid Interaction\n",
      "- **Line Clearing**: Check for complete rows; remove completed rows and shift everything above down.\n",
      "- **Transformation**: Upon locking, convert locked tetrominoes into random colored gems.\n",
      "- **Interaction with Gems**: If a tetromino locks in a position that creates an adjacent gem formation, immediately trigger the gem matching mechanics.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. Match-3 Mechanics (Overview)\n",
      "- **Gem Matching**: Check for groups of three or more adjacent gems of the same color.\n",
      "- **Clearing Gems**: Remove matched gems and trigger cascading clears if new matches occur.\n",
      "- **Cascading Effects**: After a tetromino locks, if a matching area occurs, it should trigger a clear and may lead to another score increment based on chain reactions.\n",
      "- **Score Update**: Increment the score based on the number of cleared gems and any consequential chains.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. User Interface (GUI)\n",
      "### 4.1 Layout\n",
      "- **Game Grid Display**: Render the grid and current state (tetrominoes and gems).\n",
      "- **Score Display**: Show current score prominently on the screen.\n",
      "- **Next Tetromino Preview**: Display the next tetromino that will fall.\n",
      "- **Controls Display**: Provide a reference for player controls (instructions on how to play and activate power-ups).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4.2 Animations\n",
      "- **Falling Tetrominoes**: Smooth dropping animations as tetrominoes move down.\n",
      "- **Gem Transformations**: Visual effects for transforming tetrominoes into gems.\n",
      "- **Clearing Effects**: Animate the process of clearing matched gems, with visual cues to signal successful actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. Additional Features\n",
      "- **Difficulty Scaling**: Increase speed and frequency of tetromino drops as the score rises.\n",
      "- **Power-ups**: Implement special gems that can clear larger areas or all gems of a color; these should be visually distinct to make them noticeable.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 6. Implementation Framework\n",
      "- **Game Development Framework**: Use Pygame for rendering, input handling, and animations.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 7. Development Plan\n",
      "1. Create the grid and implement tetromino spawning and locking logic.\n",
      "2. Implement gem transformation and line clearing.\n",
      "3. Integrate interaction mechanics with gem matching post-tetromino lock.\n",
      "4. Develop match-3 detection and clearing mechanisms.\n",
      "5. Design and implement the GUI components, including control instructions.\n",
      "6. Integrate animations for a smooth player experience with feedback.\n",
      "7. Test and refine gameplay mechanics for balance. \n",
      "\n",
      "This architecture serves as a foundational blueprint for development, guiding modular implementation of core features and interactions within the game, while ensuring clarity and player engagement.\n",

      "  Result: # Game Architecture Design for Tetris-Bejeweled Fusion\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. Game Components\n",
      "- **Grid**: A 2D array representing the game area (e.g., 10 columns x 20 rows).\n",
      "- **Tetrominoes**: Various shapes (I, O, T, S, Z, J, L) that can fall and occupy grid spaces.\n",
      "- **Gems**: Colored blocks representing the transformed tetrominoes after locking.\n",
      "- **Score System**: Tracks the player's score, updating for line clears and gem matches.\n",
      "- **Game States**: Main menu, playing, paused, and game over states.\n",
      "- **Controls**: Player controls for moving (left, right, down), rotating tetrominoes, and initiating special gem powers.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. Game Logic\n",
      "### 2.1 Tetromino Management\n",
      "- **Spawn**: Randomly generate a tetromino at the top of the grid.\n",
      "- **Movement**: Control tetromino movement (left, right, down) and rotation.\n",
      "- **Locking Mechanism**: When a tetromino cannot move down further, it locks into the grid, transforming into gems.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2.2 Grid Interaction\n",
      "- **Line Clearing**: Check for complete rows; remove completed rows and shift everything above down.\n",
      "- **Transformation**: Upon locking, convert locked tetrominoes into random colored gems.\n",
      "- **Interaction with Gems**: If a tetromino locks in a position that creates an adjacent gem formation, immediately trigger the gem matching mechanics.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. Match-3 Mechanics (Overview)\n",
      "- **Gem Matching**: Check for groups of three or more adjacent gems of the same color.\n",
      "- **Clearing Gems**: Remove matched gems and trigger cascading clears if new matches occur.\n",
      "- **Cascading Effects**: After a tetromino locks, if a matching area occurs, it should trigger a clear and may lead to another score increment based on chain reactions.\n",
      "- **Score Update**: Increment the score based on the number of cleared gems and any consequential chains.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. User Interface (GUI)\n",
      "### 4.1 Layout\n",
      "- **Game Grid Display**: Render the grid and current state (tetrominoes and gems).\n",
      "- **Score Display**: Show current score prominently on the screen.\n",
      "- **Next Tetromino Preview**: Display the next tetromino that will fall.\n",
      "- **Controls Display**: Provide a reference for player controls (instructions on how to play and activate power-ups).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4.2 Animations\n",
      "- **Falling Tetrominoes**: Smooth dropping animations as tetrominoes move down.\n",
      "- **Gem Transformations**: Visual effects for transforming tetrominoes into gems.\n",
      "- **Clearing Effects**: Animate the process of clearing matched gems, with visual cues to signal successful actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. Additional Features\n",
      "- **Difficulty Scaling**: Increase speed and frequency of tetromino drops as the score rises.\n",
      "- **Power-ups**: Implement special gems that can clear larger areas or all gems of a color; these should be visually distinct to make them noticeable.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 6. Implementation Framework\n",
      "- **Game Development Framework**: Use Pygame for rendering, input handling, and animations.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 7. Development Plan\n",
      "1. Create the grid and implement tetromino spawning and locking logic.\n",
      "2. Implement gem transformation and line clearing.\n",
      "3. Integrate interaction mechanics with gem matching post-tetromino lock.\n",
      "4. Develop match-3 detection and clearing mechanisms.\n",
      "5. Design and implement the GUI components, including control instructions.\n",
      "6. Integrate animations for a smooth player experience with feedback.\n",
      "7. Test and refine gameplay mechanics for balance. \n",
      "\n",

      "# **The Overall Goal**\n",
      "Develop a game that fuses Tetris and Bejeweled mechanics. \n",
      "Falling tetrominoes should lock into a grid and transform into colored gems. \n",
      "The game must support both Tetris line-clearing and Bejeweled match-3 clearing, triggering chain reactions and bonus points. \n",
      "Include a GUI (using a framework like Pygame) that displays the game grid, current score, and next tetromino preview, along with smooth animations.\n",

      "# **Context from Upstream Tasks**\n",
      "Task task0:\n",
      "  Objective: Design the overall game architecture, including the fusion of Tetris and Bejeweled mechanics.\n",
      "  Result: # Game Architecture Design for Tetris-Bejeweled Fusion\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. Game Components\n",
      "- **Grid**: A 2D array representing the game area (e.g., 10 columns x 20 rows).\n",
      "- **Tetrominoes**: Various shapes (I, O, T, S, Z, J, L) that can fall and occupy grid spaces.\n",
      "- **Gems**: Colored blocks representing the transformed tetrominoes after locking.\n",
      "- **Score System**: Tracks the player's score, updating for line clears and gem matches.\n",
      "- **Game States**: Main menu, playing, paused, and game over states.\n",
      "- **Controls**: Player controls for moving (left, right, down), rotating tetrominoes, and initiating special gem powers.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. Game Logic\n",
      "### 2.1 Tetromino Management\n",
      "- **Spawn**: Randomly generate a tetromino at the top of the grid.\n",
      "- **Movement**: Control tetromino movement (left, right, down) and rotation.\n",
      "- **Locking Mechanism**: When a tetromino cannot move down further, it locks into the grid, transforming into gems.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2.2 Grid Interaction\n",
      "- **Line Clearing**: Check for complete rows; remove completed rows and shift everything above down.\n",
      "- **Transformation**: Upon locking, convert locked tetrominoes into random colored gems.\n",
      "- **Interaction with Gems**: If a tetromino locks in a position that creates an adjacent gem formation, immediately trigger the gem matching mechanics.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. Match-3 Mechanics (Overview)\n",
      "- **Gem Matching**: Check for groups of three or more adjacent gems of the same color.\n",
      "- **Clearing Gems**: Remove matched gems and trigger cascading clears if new matches occur.\n",
      "- **Cascading Effects**: After a tetromino locks, if a matching area occurs, it should trigger a clear and may lead to another score increment based on chain reactions.\n",
      "- **Score Update**: Increment the score based on the number of cleared gems and any consequential chains.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. User Interface (GUI)\n",
      "### 4.1 Layout\n",
      "- **Game Grid Display**: Render the grid and current state (tetrominoes and gems).\n",
      "- **Score Display**: Show current score prominently on the screen.\n",
      "- **Next Tetromino Preview**: Display the next tetromino that will fall.\n",
      "- **Controls Display**: Provide a reference for player controls (instructions on how to play and activate power-ups).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4.2 Animations\n",
      "- **Falling Tetrominoes**: Smooth dropping animations as tetrominoes move down.\n",
      "- **Gem Transformations**: Visual effects for transforming tetrominoes into gems.\n",
      "- **Clearing Effects**: Animate the process of clearing matched gems, with visual cues to signal successful actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. Additional Features\n",
      "- **Difficulty Scaling**: Increase speed and frequency of tetromino drops as the score rises.\n",
      "- **Power-ups**: Implement special gems that can clear larger areas or all gems of a color; these should be visually distinct to make them noticeable.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 6. Implementation Framework\n",
      "- **Game Development Framework**: Use Pygame for rendering, input handling, and animations.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 7. Development Plan\n",
      "1. Create the grid and implement tetromino spawning and locking logic.\n",
      "2. Implement gem transformation and line clearing.\n",
      "3. Integrate interaction mechanics with gem matching post-tetromino lock.\n",
      "4. Develop match-3 detection and clearing mechanisms.\n",
      "5. Design and implement the GUI components, including control instructions.\n",
      "6. Integrate animations for a smooth player experience with feedback.\n",
      "7. Test and refine gameplay mechanics for balance. \n",
      "\n",
      "This architecture serves as a foundational blueprint for development, guiding modular implementation of core features and interactions within the game, while ensuring clarity and player engagement.\n",

      "Falling tetrominoes should lock into a grid and transform into colored gems. \n",
      "The game must support both Tetris line-clearing and Bejeweled match-3 clearing, triggering chain reactions and bonus points. \n",
      "Include a GUI (using a framework like Pygame) that displays the game grid, current score, and next tetromino preview, along with smooth animations.\n",

      "# **Context from Upstream Tasks**\n",
      "Task task0:\n",
      "  Objective: Design the overall game architecture, including the fusion of Tetris and Bejeweled mechanics.\n",
      "  Result: # Game Architecture Design for Tetris-Bejeweled Fusion\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. Game Components\n",
      "- **Grid**: A 2D array representing the game area (e.g., 10 columns x 20 rows).\n",
      "- **Tetrominoes**: Various shapes (I, O, T, S, Z, J, L) that can fall and occupy grid spaces.\n",
      "- **Gems**: Colored blocks representing the transformed tetrominoes after locking.\n",
      "- **Score System**: Tracks the player's score, updating for line clears and gem matches.\n",
      "- **Game States**: Main menu, playing, paused, and game over states.\n",
      "- **Controls**: Player controls for moving (left, right, down), rotating tetrominoes, and initiating special gem powers.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. Game Logic\n",
      "### 2.1 Tetromino Management\n",
      "- **Spawn**: Randomly generate a tetromino at the top of the grid.\n",
      "- **Movement**: Control tetromino movement (left, right, down) and rotation.\n",
      "- **Locking Mechanism**: When a tetromino cannot move down further, it locks into the grid, transforming into gems.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2.2 Grid Interaction\n",
      "- **Line Clearing**: Check for complete rows; remove completed rows and shift everything above down.\n",
      "- **Transformation**: Upon locking, convert locked tetrominoes into random colored gems.\n",
      "- **Interaction with Gems**: If a tetromino locks in a position that creates an adjacent gem formation, immediately trigger the gem matching mechanics.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. Match-3 Mechanics (Overview)\n",
      "- **Gem Matching**: Check for groups of three or more adjacent gems of the same color.\n",
      "- **Clearing Gems**: Remove matched gems and trigger cascading clears if new matches occur.\n",
      "- **Cascading Effects**: After a tetromino locks, if a matching area occurs, it should trigger a clear and may lead to another score increment based on chain reactions.\n",
      "- **Score Update**: Increment the score based on the number of cleared gems and any consequential chains.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. User Interface (GUI)\n",
      "### 4.1 Layout\n",
      "- **Game Grid Display**: Render the grid and current state (tetrominoes and gems).\n",
      "- **Score Display**: Show current score prominently on the screen.\n",
      "- **Next Tetromino Preview**: Display the next tetromino that will fall.\n",
      "- **Controls Display**: Provide a reference for player controls (instructions on how to play and activate power-ups).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4.2 Animations\n",
      "- **Falling Tetrominoes**: Smooth dropping animations as tetrominoes move down.\n",
      "- **Gem Transformations**: Visual effects for transforming tetrominoes into gems.\n",
      "- **Clearing Effects**: Animate the process of clearing matched gems, with visual cues to signal successful actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. Additional Features\n",
      "- **Difficulty Scaling**: Increase speed and frequency of tetromino drops as the score rises.\n",
      "- **Power-ups**: Implement special gems that can clear larger areas or all gems of a color; these should be visually distinct to make them noticeable.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 6. Implementation Framework\n",
      "- **Game Development Framework**: Use Pygame for rendering, input handling, and animations.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 7. Development Plan\n",
      "1. Create the grid and implement tetromino spawning and locking logic.\n",
      "2. Implement gem transformation and line clearing.\n",
      "3. Integrate interaction mechanics with gem matching post-tetromino lock.\n",
      "4. Develop match-3 detection and clearing mechanisms.\n",
      "5. Design and implement the GUI components, including control instructions.\n",
      "6. Integrate animations for a smooth player experience with feedback.\n",
      "7. Test and refine gameplay mechanics for balance. \n",
      "\n",
      "This architecture serves as a foundational blueprint for development, guiding modular implementation of core features and interactions within the game, while ensuring clarity and player engagement.\n",

      "  Objective: Design the overall game architecture, including the fusion of Tetris and Bejeweled mechanics.\n",
      "  Result: # Game Architecture Design for Tetris-Bejeweled Fusion\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. Game Components\n",
      "- **Grid**: A 2D array representing the game area (e.g., 10 columns x 20 rows).\n",
      "- **Tetrominoes**: Various shapes (I, O, T, S, Z, J, L) that can fall and occupy grid spaces.\n",
      "- **Gems**: Colored blocks representing the transformed tetrominoes after locking.\n",
      "- **Score System**: Tracks the player's score, updating for line clears and gem matches.\n",
      "- **Game States**: Main menu, playing, paused, and game over states.\n",
      "- **Controls**: Player controls for moving (left, right, down), rotating tetrominoes, and initiating special gem powers.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. Game Logic\n",
      "### 2.1 Tetromino Management\n",
      "- **Spawn**: Randomly generate a tetromino at the top of the grid.\n",
      "- **Movement**: Control tetromino movement (left, right, down) and rotation.\n",
      "- **Locking Mechanism**: When a tetromino cannot move down further, it locks into the grid, transforming into gems.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2.2 Grid Interaction\n",
      "- **Line Clearing**: Check for complete rows; remove completed rows and shift everything above down.\n",
      "- **Transformation**: Upon locking, convert locked tetrominoes into random colored gems.\n",
      "- **Interaction with Gems**: If a tetromino locks in a position that creates an adjacent gem formation, immediately trigger the gem matching mechanics.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. Match-3 Mechanics (Overview)\n",
      "- **Gem Matching**: Check for groups of three or more adjacent gems of the same color.\n",
      "- **Clearing Gems**: Remove matched gems and trigger cascading clears if new matches occur.\n",
      "- **Cascading Effects**: After a tetromino locks, if a matching area occurs, it should trigger a clear and may lead to another score increment based on chain reactions.\n",
      "- **Score Update**: Increment the score based on the number of cleared gems and any consequential chains.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. User Interface (GUI)\n",
      "### 4.1 Layout\n",
      "- **Game Grid Display**: Render the grid and current state (tetrominoes and gems).\n",
      "- **Score Display**: Show current score prominently on the screen.\n",
      "- **Next Tetromino Preview**: Display the next tetromino that will fall.\n",
      "- **Controls Display**: Provide a reference for player controls (instructions on how to play and activate power-ups).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4.2 Animations\n",
      "- **Falling Tetrominoes**: Smooth dropping animations as tetrominoes move down.\n",
      "- **Gem Transformations**: Visual effects for transforming tetrominoes into gems.\n",
      "- **Clearing Effects**: Animate the process of clearing matched gems, with visual cues to signal successful actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. Additional Features\n",
      "- **Difficulty Scaling**: Increase speed and frequency of tetromino drops as the score rises.\n",
      "- **Power-ups**: Implement special gems that can clear larger areas or all gems of a color; these should be visually distinct to make them noticeable.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 6. Implementation Framework\n",
      "- **Game Development Framework**: Use Pygame for rendering, input handling, and animations.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 7. Development Plan\n",
      "1. Create the grid and implement tetromino spawning and locking logic.\n",
      "2. Implement gem transformation and line clearing.\n",
      "3. Integrate interaction mechanics with gem matching post-tetromino lock.\n",
      "4. Develop match-3 detection and clearing mechanisms.\n",
      "5. Design and implement the GUI components, including control instructions.\n",
      "6. Integrate animations for a smooth player experience with feedback.\n",
      "7. Test and refine gameplay mechanics for balance. \n",
      "\n",
      "This architecture serves as a foundational blueprint for development, guiding modular implementation of core features and interactions within the game, while ensuring clarity and player engagement.\n",

      "  Result: # Game Architecture Design for Tetris-Bejeweled Fusion\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. Game Components\n",
      "- **Grid**: A 2D array representing the game area (e.g., 10 columns x 20 rows).\n",
      "- **Tetrominoes**: Various shapes (I, O, T, S, Z, J, L) that can fall and occupy grid spaces.\n",
      "- **Gems**: Colored blocks representing the transformed tetrominoes after locking.\n",
      "- **Score System**: Tracks the player's score, updating for line clears and gem matches.\n",
      "- **Game States**: Main menu, playing, paused, and game over states.\n",
      "- **Controls**: Player controls for moving (left, right, down), rotating tetrominoes, and initiating special gem powers.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. Game Logic\n",
      "### 2.1 Tetromino Management\n",
      "- **Spawn**: Randomly generate a tetromino at the top of the grid.\n",
      "- **Movement**: Control tetromino movement (left, right, down) and rotation.\n",
      "- **Locking Mechanism**: When a tetromino cannot move down further, it locks into the grid, transforming into gems.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2.2 Grid Interaction\n",
      "- **Line Clearing**: Check for complete rows; remove completed rows and shift everything above down.\n",
      "- **Transformation**: Upon locking, convert locked tetrominoes into random colored gems.\n",
      "- **Interaction with Gems**: If a tetromino locks in a position that creates an adjacent gem formation, immediately trigger the gem matching mechanics.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. Match-3 Mechanics (Overview)\n",
      "- **Gem Matching**: Check for groups of three or more adjacent gems of the same color.\n",
      "- **Clearing Gems**: Remove matched gems and trigger cascading clears if new matches occur.\n",
      "- **Cascading Effects**: After a tetromino locks, if a matching area occurs, it should trigger a clear and may lead to another score increment based on chain reactions.\n",
      "- **Score Update**: Increment the score based on the number of cleared gems and any consequential chains.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. User Interface (GUI)\n",
      "### 4.1 Layout\n",
      "- **Game Grid Display**: Render the grid and current state (tetrominoes and gems).\n",
      "- **Score Display**: Show current score prominently on the screen.\n",
      "- **Next Tetromino Preview**: Display the next tetromino that will fall.\n",
      "- **Controls Display**: Provide a reference for player controls (instructions on how to play and activate power-ups).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4.2 Animations\n",
      "- **Falling Tetrominoes**: Smooth dropping animations as tetrominoes move down.\n",
      "- **Gem Transformations**: Visual effects for transforming tetrominoes into gems.\n",
      "- **Clearing Effects**: Animate the process of clearing matched gems, with visual cues to signal successful actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. Additional Features\n",
      "- **Difficulty Scaling**: Increase speed and frequency of tetromino drops as the score rises.\n",
      "- **Power-ups**: Implement special gems that can clear larger areas or all gems of a color; these should be visually distinct to make them noticeable.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 6. Implementation Framework\n",
      "- **Game Development Framework**: Use Pygame for rendering, input handling, and animations.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 7. Development Plan\n",
      "1. Create the grid and implement tetromino spawning and locking logic.\n",
      "2. Implement gem transformation and line clearing.\n",
      "3. Integrate interaction mechanics with gem matching post-tetromino lock.\n",
      "4. Develop match-3 detection and clearing mechanisms.\n",
      "5. Design and implement the GUI components, including control instructions.\n",
      "6. Integrate animations for a smooth player experience with feedback.\n",
      "7. Test and refine gameplay mechanics for balance. \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "## 1. Game Components\n",
      "- **Grid**: A 2D array representing the game area (e.g., 10 columns x 20 rows).\n",
      "- **Tetrominoes**: Various shapes (I, O, T, S, Z, J, L) that can fall and occupy grid spaces.\n",
      "- **Gems**: Colored blocks representing the transformed tetrominoes after locking.\n",
      "- **Score System**: Tracks the player's score, updating for line clears and gem matches.\n",
      "- **Game States**: Main menu, playing, paused, and game over states.\n",
      "- **Controls**: Player controls for moving (left, right, down), rotating tetrominoes, and initiating special gem powers.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. Game Logic\n",
      "### 2.1 Tetromino Management\n",
      "- **Spawn**: Randomly generate a tetromino at the top of the grid.\n",
      "- **Movement**: Control tetromino movement (left, right, down) and rotation.\n",
      "- **Locking Mechanism**: When a tetromino cannot move down further, it locks into the grid, transforming into gems.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2.2 Grid Interaction\n",
      "- **Line Clearing**: Check for complete rows; remove completed rows and shift everything above down.\n",
      "- **Transformation**: Upon locking, convert locked tetrominoes into random colored gems.\n",
      "- **Interaction with Gems**: If a tetromino locks in a position that creates an adjacent gem formation, immediately trigger the gem matching mechanics.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. Match-3 Mechanics (Overview)\n",
      "- **Gem Matching**: Check for groups of three or more adjacent gems of the same color.\n",
      "- **Clearing Gems**: Remove matched gems and trigger cascading clears if new matches occur.\n",
      "- **Cascading Effects**: After a tetromino locks, if a matching area occurs, it should trigger a clear and may lead to another score increment based on chain reactions.\n",
      "- **Score Update**: Increment the score based on the number of cleared gems and any consequential chains.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. User Interface (GUI)\n",
      "### 4.1 Layout\n",
      "- **Game Grid Display**: Render the grid and current state (tetrominoes and gems).\n",
      "- **Score Display**: Show current score prominently on the screen.\n",
      "- **Next Tetromino Preview**: Display the next tetromino that will fall.\n",
      "- **Controls Display**: Provide a reference for player controls (instructions on how to play and activate power-ups).\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4.2 Animations\n",
      "- **Falling Tetrominoes**: Smooth dropping animations as tetrominoes move down.\n",
      "- **Gem Transformations**: Visual effects for transforming tetrominoes into gems.\n",
      "- **Clearing Effects**: Animate the process of clearing matched gems, with visual cues to signal successful actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. Additional Features\n",
      "- **Difficulty Scaling**: Increase speed and frequency of tetromino drops as the score rises.\n",
      "- **Power-ups**: Implement special gems that can clear larger areas or all gems of a color; these should be visually distinct to make them noticeable.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 6. Implementation Framework\n",
      "- **Game Development Framework**: Use Pygame for rendering, input handling, and animations.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 7. Development Plan\n",
      "1. Create the grid and implement tetromino spawning and locking logic.\n",
      "2. Implement gem transformation and line clearing.\n",
      "3. Integrate interaction mechanics with gem matching post-tetromino lock.\n",
      "4. Develop match-3 detection and clearing mechanisms.\n",
      "5. Design and implement the GUI components, including control instructions.\n",
      "6. Integrate animations for a smooth player experience with feedback.\n",
      "7. Test and refine gameplay mechanics for balance. \n",
      "\n",
      "This architecture serves as a foundational blueprint for development, guiding modular implementation of core features and interactions within the game, while ensuring clarity and player engagement.\n",
